This repository contains all of the files created for my research to date. 

## Genomics 
The Genomics directory provides example files for those used in the genome wide association analysis. This includes shell scripts for running the SNPTEST software, an example sample file for patient coviarates and toxicity endpoints, and a jupyter notebook containing the python code used to create the sample files. This directory also contains the code used for the analysis of the output data from the SNPTEST software for graphs and data visualisation.
